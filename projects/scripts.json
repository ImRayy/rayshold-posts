  "description": "Again, not a project but worth including. Time to time I make new scripts to make my daily life somewhat easier like printing helper, kdeconnect-cli wrapper, sort images (like put mobile and desktop images to their respective folder), convert images in bulk etc... Like it's not impossible to find similar tools online but I prefer not to throw my hands just to accomplish some jobs.",
